            <h3 class=" col col-2" >COFFEE BEANS <BR>A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant, the source for coffee. It is the pip inside the purple fruit often referred to as a coffee cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a so-called stone fruit. Even though the coffee beans are not technically beans, they are referred to as such because of their resemblance to true beans. The fruits; cherries or berries, most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together.</BR></h3>

            <h3 class=" col col-3" > TEA  <BR>Tea or cha is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar.[3][4][5] Tea is also rarely made from the leaves of Camellia taliensis.[6][7][8] After plain water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.</BR></h3>
